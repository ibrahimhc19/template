# React Component Structure Skill

## Goal
Ensure components are maintainable, readable, and follow single responsibility principles.

## Rules

### Component Design
- Use functional components only
- Each component must have a single responsibility
- Keep components under ~150 lines

### File Naming
- File name must match component name (PascalCase)
- One component per file

### Props
- Always define props using TypeScript interfaces
- Destructure props in function signature
- Avoid passing unnecessary props

Example:
```ts
interface UserCardProps {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

export const UserCard = ({ name, email }: UserCardProps) => {}
```

### Rendering

* Prefer early returns
* Avoid nested ternaries
* Move complex conditions to variables

### Separation of Concerns

* No API calls inside components
* No heavy business logic inside components

### Composition

* Prefer composition over large components
* Split UI into smaller reusable pieces

## Anti-patterns

* Components handling UI + API + state logic
* Files larger than ~200 lines
* Inline anonymous functions everywhere

## Behavior

* Refactor oversized components into smaller ones
* Suggest extracting logic into hooks if needed
* Suggest moving state to Zustand if global
